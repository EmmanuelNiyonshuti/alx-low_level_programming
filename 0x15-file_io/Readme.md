0x15. File I/O

This project in C focuses on mastering file input/output operations.
By completing the tasks, I gained proficiency in creating, opening, reading, and writing files, understanding file descriptors and system calls,
and managing file permissions.
The concise code challenges emphasize error handling, reinforcing my ability to use open, close, read, and write functions effectively.
This project is a hands-on opportunity for any aspiring programmer to solidify their file I/O skills in a real-world context.
