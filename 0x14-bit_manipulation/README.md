	# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

	##Overview

	Welcome to my Bit Manipulation in C project! This project is part of my journey in the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on bitwise operations and bit manipulation in the C programming language. The tasks range from converting binary to unsigned integers to more advanced operations like setting, clearing, and flipping bits.

	Compilation and Execution

	All files can be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options:

	$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_file>
$ ./<output_file>

	Learning Objectives
	Mastering bitwise operators and bit manipulation techniques.
	Efficient sourcing of information.
	Writing clean and efficient code following project requirements.

	Task Overview

	Binary to Unsigned Int

	Convert a binary number to an unsigned int.
	Print Binary

	Print the binary representation of a number.
	Get Bit

	Return the value of a bit at a given index.
	Set Bit

	Set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
	Clear Bit

	Set the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
	Flip Bits

	Return the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

	Coding Guidelines
	Using allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
	Following the Betty style for clean code.
	Limiting functions to a maximum of 5 per file.
	Using only allowed C standard library functions.
	Including prototypes in the main.h header file.

	Conclusion
	This project provided me with hands-on experience with bitwise operations, enhancing my
	ability to work with individual bits in integers. It's a journey
	into the heart of low-level programming, and I'm excited to dive in.
