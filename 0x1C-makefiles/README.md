This project is designed for learning Makefiles in C programming. It includes a series of tasks that cover fundamental concepts such as make, rules, variables, and efficient compilation strategies. By completing these tasks, I gained practical experience in managing the build process of C programs using Makefiles. The project provides hands-on learning opportunities, guiding me from basic Makefile creation to more advanced functionalities like managing dependencies and cleaning up temporary files.
