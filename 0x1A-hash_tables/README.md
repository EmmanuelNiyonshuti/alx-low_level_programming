This Directory focus on Hash Table data structure. Hash Table is a data structure that maps keys to values.
Hash Tables are the underlying data structure used to implement dictionaries or associative arrays.
They use hash function to compute an index or position in an array where the values associated with the key should be stored.
In this directory I will implement a hash table data structure in C language.
